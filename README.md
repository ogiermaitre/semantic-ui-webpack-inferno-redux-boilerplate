# A semantic-ui, webpack, inferno, redux boilerplate

A small frontend which uses semantic-ui, webpack, inferno, redux boilerplate, with a menu system that needs some improvement.


Largely inspired from [atomicpages/semantic-ui-webpack2-boilerplate](https://github.com/atomicpages/semantic-ui-webpack2-boilerplate)

Currently it uses:
- semantic-ui 2.3
- inferno 4
- webpack 3
- redux 3.7.2
- babel 6.26

## Install process
```
npn -g gulp
npm i
node font-fix.js
cd semantic/
gulp build
```
